# Histograms

Histogram is a graphical representation of data that comprises a series of contiguous columns. the height of which correspond to the frequency of observations that fall within the range of values covered by each column.

## Exercise
The table represents the number of pigeon by its height in inches. 
The height is from 14 to 20 inches which makes 6 columns 
Fall represents the number of pigeon.

* What is the total number of pigeon in the table?
* How many pigeon are between 15 and 17 inches?

## Making Histograms with Pivot Tables

Video Demo: [Making a Histogram with Pivot Tables](https://youtu.be/0zQ-xQ8_Yro)

Open the **Unpivoted** (i.e., "tidy") Paris Rainfall file. It should have columns for Year, Month, Value.  Make a pivot table using Value and Count of Value:

Group the rows now:

Make a copy of the result and paste into a new sheet.  Make a bar chart.

This is a histogram!  It tells us that the range with the most values in our data is 40-49 inches of rain!  There are over 500 values in this range.
