## Installing Tableau

Here are installation instructions for the Tableau Software:

* Download the latest version of Tableau Desktop [download](https://www.tableau.com/tft/activation).

* Click on the link above and select Get Started. On the form, enter your school email address for Business E-mail and enter the name of your school for Organization.

* Activate with your product key:  I will post the product key on Brightspace

* Already have a copy of Tableau Desktop installed? Update your license in the application: Help menu -> Manage Product Keys

New to Tableau? Here a free Data Analytics for University Students [guide](https://www.tableau.com/university-students) to help them get started.

You can continue using Tableau after the class is over by individually requesting their own one-year license through the Tableau for Students program [here](https://community.tableau.com/community/students/).
